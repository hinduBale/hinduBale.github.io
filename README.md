## Where do I hang out ?

I simply love to learn and explore the core fundamentals of Computer Science.

* I dish out developer puns and some solid development thread [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hinduBale) 
* I love connecting to like-minded people and awesome company reps [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxena-rahul/)
* I am also looking for employment opportunites as a SDE too, so [here's my resume](https://hindubale.github.io/RahulSaxena_Resume.pdf)
